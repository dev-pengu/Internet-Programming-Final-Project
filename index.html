                        We here at <b>Copyright For You</b> have spent time crawling the internet to find resources you can use
                        in your online content. There is no guarantee what you find on these sites is indeed royalty free and not
                        covered under the <a href="#dmca">DMCA</a>. We encourage you to check the material you find before using
                        it in your content to avoid any penalties. If you find a resource that isn't listed on the site, feel free

                    <h3>What is Copyright?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Copyright is the legal right of the owner of intellectual property. Copyright law gives creators of 
                        original material the exclusive right to use and duplicate that material for a given amount of time. 
                        After the time has passed, the item becomes public domain and can be used and duplicated by anyone.

                    <p>
                        DMCA criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent 
                        measures that control access to copyrighted works. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for 
                        copyright infringement on the internet.

                    <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are a streamer or content creator, the DMCA can impact your ability to create quality content. 
                        If you publish content with copyrighted material, the penalties for doing so can be extreme and the content 
                        will have to be removed from the internet.
